            <h2>First Interview</h2>
            <p>On September 19, 2025, we conducted our first interview with the alumni association president, Chi Wen-Hao. Actually, our preparation was not very sufficient beforehand, so due to camera issues, we were delayed by nearly an hour. However, when we started the interview with the president, regardless of the prior mistakes, we truly enjoyed listening to his life story. From Chi Wen-Hao's talk, we learned that perseverance, tolerance, and communication are important principles he has grasped throughout his life.</p>

            <h2>Second Interview</h2>
            <p>On October 2, 2025, we recalled our previous experience and fully prepared for this interview. We quickly entered the interview phase, and this time, different individuals conducted the interview with President Chi Wen-Hao, allowing them to gain interviewing experience as well. By this time, we had already established a friendly relationship with the president, who even mentioned treating us to 阿給 (a type of Taiwanese snack) next time.</p>

            <h2>Company Visit</h2>
            <p>On December 23, 2025, this visit was different from the past. We went to the Taizong Yuan Building in front of Hongshulin Station, which is the president's usual office. We witnessed what it means to have a successful business with a tastefully designed interior. This visit not only brought stories about the president's experiences studying abroad and his relationships with local officials but also gave us a deeper understanding of how he upholds the principles of perseverance, tolerance, and communication in his life, work, and social interactions.</p>
