                <p>In 1982, WEVER Industrial Co., Ltd. was established, symbolizing the start of organizational and institutional development of the business system. From 1987 onward, with the trend of global industrial division of labor and manufacturing relocation, the business officially ventured into China, establishing a production base in Shenzhen and gradually building a cross-regional manufacturing network. This layout not only enhanced production capacity flexibility but also provided the company with a key advantage in cost competition and supply chain integration, forming an important foundation for future internationalization.</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <p>In the 1990s, the business entered the stage of internationalization. In 1990, Wever USA Inc. was established, and in 1992, an investment company was founded in Australia, indicating that the business strategy shifted from a single manufacturing focus to a combination of overseas investment and market operations. In 1995, the company ventured into water sports product manufacturing, and in 1999 expanded into the pet supplies market, gradually diversifying its product line to effectively mitigate the cyclical risks of a single industry, thus enhancing overall operational stability.</p>

            <div class="content-block">
                <p>After 2000, the company entered a period of integration and simultaneous expansion. The folding scooter was officially put into production, and the headquarters was established in Tamsui. In the same year, EzyDog International was formed, alongside subsidiaries in Australia and the United States, officially constructing a global brand system. Despite facing the global financial crisis during this period, the company continued to complete the acquisition of industrial land and construction plans in Huizhou, China, demonstrating its long-term strategic thinking rather than short-term economic maneuvers.</p>
                <p>Starting in 2010, the business territory expanded into real estate and capital investment, successively establishing investment companies in Japan and Australia. In 2017, EzyDog Taiwan Company and a construction company were founded, initiating the first residential development project. By 2022, this residential project was fully sold, symbolizing a transition from manufacturing and brand management to diversified asset allocation and stable revenue models. By 2025, the business system had spanned manufacturing, branding, investment, and real estate, reflecting a long-term planning trajectory of steady operation and continuous evolution.</p>
